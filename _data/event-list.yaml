Comprising over 15,000 books, journals, manuscripts, maps, photographs and ephemera, many of the items in the collection were inherited from the National Library’s predecessors – the Singapore Library (1844–1874) and the Raffles Museum and Library (1874–1960). The collection is also further enhanced by recent donations from institutions and individuals.
